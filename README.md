# Moco MacOS MenuBar Booking Buddy

Moco MacOS MenuBar Booking Buddy is a lightweight MacOS MenuBar application designed for seamless scheduling of project times on Moco. This tool was developed as part of a "Vibe Coding" test using entirely free cloud-based language models, including ChatGPT 4o mini (limited contingent) and Gemini 2.0 Flash in Canvas Mode. The development process was iterative and involved detailed problem-solving, as most issues were resolved through clear description and communication with the language models.

## Features

- **Moco Integration:** Connects securely via the personal API key and the Moco subdomain (e.g., _company_.mocoapp.com).
- **Time Booking:** Allows for booking in fixed 15-minute intervals.
- **Reminder System:** If no booking is made within 2 hours, the Moco Eye icon will blink, notifying the user to book their time.
- **Monochrome Icons:** Designed for both light and dark themes to provide a visually cohesive experience across different UI settings.
